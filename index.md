## About Me ðŸ˜Ž

I'm an analytics engineer based in Budapest with a dockercap who creates scalable pipelines and assists businesses in adopting modern data stack technologies in a cost-effective manner.

I have over a year of profound experience implementing solutions with dbt and the Modern Data Ecosystem. On top of that, I am passionate about giving back to the community by sharing knowledge in a variety of ways (blog posts & open-source contributions).

I graduated from Central European University's Business Analytics program with a data-heavy coursework and studied data and management at ESSEC Business School.

I hope you will enjoy my content! ðŸ¥³
